# YPT Stats
YPT Stats is a summary statistics generator for [YPT](https://pi.tgclab.com/), the group study app. It makes use of YPT's (unofficial) API, reverse-engineered from their Android app. YPT Stats is built on a very minimal tech stack: HTMX for reactivity, Twind for styling, Hono as the server and Deno as the runtime.
